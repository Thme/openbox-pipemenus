==================

Scripts for different pipemenus in openbox

Here are various or will be various pipemenus written specifically for openbox.
feel free to try them and see if you Like my work. You may find something useful.
NOTE: Currently connmenu does work. Trying to find a convenient way to support password authentication
since connmanctl doesn't currently support it.

"amenu" currently has two options. The default (with no options) is to begin logging all apps executed through the openbox menu then generate
a pipemenu containing the most frequently used apps. The second option is enabled with --recent and will generate a menu
with the most recently used apps instead.
